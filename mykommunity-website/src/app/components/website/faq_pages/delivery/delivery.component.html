        <h2>Delivery Management</h2>            
    <p><b>If there is a parcel delivery for me, who will pick it up?</b></p>
    <p>If you are on the premises, you can authorise the delivery executive’s entry by using the ‘accept’ button upon their arrival at the gate. If you are not available, you can raise a request for the guards to pick up the parcel at the gate and keep it away safely. You can collect it using the 6-digit code generated to your phone when the guard picks up the parcel.</p>
    <p><b>Should I tell the delivery executive that they will be stopped at the gate?</b></p>
    <p>All delivery executives are stopped by the guards at the gate. You need not tell the executive about the guards or the Mykommunity protocol.</p>
    <p><b>How will the guards know the package belongs to me?</b></p>
    <p>When the guards pick up a parcel that belongs to you, a 6-digit code is triggered to your phone. You can claim your parcel after giving said code to the guards.</p>
    <p><b>Where can I pick/drop off my package?</b></p>
    <p>The guards can pick up your parcels on your behalf. You can leave your ‘to be returned’ packages at the gate.</p>
    <p><b>What happens in case of damage to my package?</b></p>
    <p>We have taken many measures to ensure that your packages are not misplaced or damaged.</p>
